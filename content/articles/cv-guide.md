## :icon[lucide-file-question] Why Your CV Might Be Holding You Back

> In the world of apprenticeship applications, first impressions are everything. Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) is your first opportunity, your first chance to leave an imprint of yourself, and traverse through the application process. A well-crafted CV is not just a list of your experiences—it's a powerful story of who you are, what you've achieved, and where you're going.

> Your CV is more than just a document; it's your personal brand, and in the competitive world of job hunting, it’s the first thing potential employers will see. So, how do you make yours stand out in a sea of applicants?

> Think of it as the chance to strategically <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/personal-branding-at-work">brand</a> yourself: Highlight the skills, experiences, and achievements that speak directly to the role and its requirements. Whether it’s adjusting the emphasis on your education or tweaking the wording in your personal statement, building and customising a quality CV shows recruiters that you’ve put in the effort to align your experience with their needs.

Here's a template from an award-winning recruitment agency, from which many template examples throughout this guide are sourced from: <a href="/cv-guide-resources/dartmouth.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth CV</a>

## :icon[lucide-file-stack] Creating Your "Master CV"

**What is a Master CV?**

A "Master CV" is a comprehensive document that contains *all* of your work experience, skills, education, and achievements.  Think of it as your CV "toolbox."  You'll then select and tailor specific pieces from this toolbox to create targeted CVs for each job application.

**Why Create a Master CV?**

*   Saves Time: You don't have to start from scratch each time you apply for a job.
*   Ensures Completeness: You won't forget any important details.
*   Provides a Foundation: It's easier to tailor a CV than to create one from nothing.

**Action Step:** Create a new document titled "Master CV" and start listing *everything* you've ever done, both professionally and academically. We'll show you how to organize it in the following sections.

## :icon[lucide-building-2] Work Experience

| Element | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Company Name** |  Name of the company where you worked. |  Acme Corp |
| **Location, Country** | City and country where the company is located. | London, UK |
| **Role/Event** |  Your job title or the name of the event. | Data Scientist Intern |
| **Start - End Date** |  The period you worked there.  Use "Present" if you still work there. | Feb 2023 - Present |
| **Responsibilities & Achievements** |  Use bullet points to describe your key responsibilities and achievements.  Focus on impact. |  <ul><li>Led the development of X</li><li>Reduced costs by £££</li></ul> |

<br/>

### Example Work Experience Entry

**Acme Corp**  
London, UK

*Data Scientist Intern*  
Feb 2023 - Present

- Collaborated with a team of data engineers to develop a Python script using Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and preprocessing a large dataset of legislative documents, reducing data inconsistencies by 30% and improving data quality for downstream analysis.
- Participated in code reviews and provided feedback to other team members, ensuring code quality and adherence to coding standards

>  :icon[lucide-info] Remember if you are applying for ‘Project Management’ for instance, you could focus more on how you handled constraints, or coordinated resources, and write “Project Manager Intern” or the relevant role instead.

>  :icon[lucide-info] If possible, each experience should cover a different part of the job description, or your skillset, instead of repeating similar points. Even if you completed similar tasks, you can break down subsections of an experience, to emphasise versatility and willingness to learn - key attributes for an apprentice.




### Quick Tips for Your CV:

|                                      |                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]       | Try to keep each point between 1 and 2 lines.                                                         |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]        | **What you did & how (skills/job description) → Measurable impact (quantified).**                                                     |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] | Use keywords which emphasise the soft skills essential for the role, e.g. “Co-ordinated the team...”, “Analysed survey responses to identify trends…”.                  |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                | When adapting the master CV to an application, consider the culture of the company and the job description.                                                          |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                   | **Never lie!** Authenticity is crucial.                                                |


<br/>

## :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] Considerations:

-   **Consistency is KEY!**
-   Always start from most to least recent
-   Ensure no spelling or grammar errors.
-   Some companies will have AI filtering. To prepare for this, try and use as many important keywords from the job description which naturally fit. Use our [FREE CV Optimiser](/optimise-cv) to help you
-   When read by a recruiter, they will spend less than a minute reading, so focus on what you did, and why it mattered (impact) in the first line of each experience -**Measurable impacts!**
-   If it’s hard to quantify your work, use “Action” & “Result” from the <a href = "https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/starr-method">STARR framework</a>, and estimate the impact of what you did
