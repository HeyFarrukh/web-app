## :icon[lucide-file-question] Why Your CV Might Be Holding You Back

> In the world of apprenticeship applications, first impressions are everything. Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) is your first opportunity, your first chance to leave an imprint of yourself, and traverse through the application process. A well-crafted CV is not just a list of your experiences—it's a powerful story of who you are, what you've achieved, and where you're going. 

> Your CV is more than just a document; it's your personal brand, and in the competitive world of job hunting, it’s the first thing potential employers will see. So, how do you make yours stand out in a sea of applicants?

> Think of it as the chance to strategically <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/personal-branding-at-work">brand</a> yourself: Highlight the skills, experiences, and achievements that speak directly to the role and its requirements. Whether it’s adjusting the emphasis on your education or tweaking the wording in your personal statement, building and customising a quality CV shows recruiters that you’ve put in the effort to align your experience with their needs.

Here's a template from an award-winning recruitment agency, from which many template examples throughout this guide are sourced from: <a href="/cv-guide-resources/dartmouth.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth CV</a>

## :icon[lucide-file-stack] The Master CV: Your Foundation

> If anything, your details are the one part of your CV that should stay the same, regardless of the company you’re applying to. In other words, it should go unchanged from the <a href="https://www.jobteaser.com/en/advices/153-why-you-should-always-keep-a-master-cv">Master CV</a> - a resume that has absolutely everything that you would ever want to include in an application. To simplify things, your master CV should emphasise your strongest skills, and be centered around your ideal company.

> However, each CV should be tailored to the job description and culture of the company in order to emphasise your points, and showcase why you could be a perfect fit for the vacancy. This includes everything from the subjects highlighted in education, down to the headlined skills & achievements, and the personal statement.

> A personal statement is not a must-have for a CV, especially when you have many experiences to draw from. Nonetheless, a personal statement or career objective could be expected by recruiters, or useful when differentiating from other applicants. In certain industries, such as hospitality, a personal statement can act as a prerequisite to an interview, giving insight to your character and goals. If anything, use it to showcase your motivation behind working "here" rather than anywhere else. Research!

## :icon[lucide-building-2] Work Experience/Professional

### Most Recent Relevant Work Experience Firm
**Location, Country**

#### Role/Event  
Start (Month, Year) - End/“Present”

- Talk about the impact of your work with measurable impacts if possible. If it was a workshop or other type of professional event, display the attributes, professional behaviours, and skills you learnt or refined.
- Second piece of information perhaps detailing a project that you helped with – or another relevant achievement.
- Final highlight – don’t waffle- you can go into extra detail once you’re in the interview.


### Quick Tips for Your CV:

|                                      |                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]       | Try to keep each point between 1 and 2 lines.                                                         |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]        | **What you did & how (skills/job description) → Measurable impact (quantified).**                                                     |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] | Use keywords which emphasise the soft skills essential for the role, e.g. “Co-ordinated the team...”, “Analysed survey responses to identify trends…”.                  |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                | When adapting the master CV to an application, consider the culture of the company and the job description.                                                          |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                   | **Never lie!** Authenticity is crucial.                                                |

### :icon[lucide-briefcase] Consulting/Tech Example:

**PA Consulting** | London, UK
*Data Scientist Intern* | *Feb 2025*

- Led the development of an AI application dedicated to monitoring legislative regulatory changes, substantially reducing administrative overhead and repetitive tasks by 90%.
- Supervised a small team using the Scrum framework, ensuring collaborative environments and high-quality work.

> :icon[lucide-info] Whilst this example could be derived from the master CV, if you were applying for ‘Project Management’ for instance, you could focus more on how you handled constraints, or coordinated resources, and write “Project Manager Intern” instead.

> :icon[lucide-info] If possible, each experience should cover a different part of the job description, or your skillset, instead of repeating similar points. Even if you completed similar tasks, you can break down subsections of an experience, to emphasise versatility and willingness to learn - key attributes for an apprentice.

<br/>

### :icon[lucide-braces] Student Example (Hackathon):

**Sans AI Hackathon** | London, UK
*Participant* | *November 2024*

- Built a smart home energy monitor (Python, Raspberry Pi), presenting findings of **up to 40% increased efficiency** to judges.
- Integrated various sensors to collect data on electricity usage, then processed the data to create actionable insights; creating a working prototype that tracked energy usage with **95% accuracy.**

> Even if you haven’t had any desirable internships or the most relevant work experience, you still have experience! Think about::
> :icon[lucide-search]
> - **Volunteering:** Did you help at a charity or school event?
> - **School Projects:** Have you worked on coding projects, presentations, or group work?
> - **Part-time Jobs/Hobbies:**  Do you create websites, edit videos, or manage social media?

## :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] Considerations:

-   **Consistency is KEY!**
-   Always start from most to least recent
-   Ensure no spelling or grammar errors.
-   Some companies will have AI filtering. To prepare for this, try and use as many important keywords from the job description which naturally fit. Use our CV optimisation to help you
-   When read by a recruiter, they will spend less than a minute reading, so focus on what you did, and why it mattered (impact) in the first line of each experience -**Measurable impacts!**
-   If it’s hard to quantify your work, use “Action” & “Result” from the <a href = "https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/starr-method">STARR framework</a>, and estimate the impact of what you did

### 2. Common CV Mistakes to Avoid
- Overloading with unnecessary details.

- **Task**: What was your responsibility?
- **Action**: What did you do?
- **Result**: What was the outcome?
- **Reflection**: What did you learn from this experience?

#### Example:
- ✅ **"Developed a Python script to automate data collection, reducing manual work by 60%."**

### 5. Online Presence & Portfolio
- Make LinkedIn stand out by adding bio, experience, and projects.

- Find keywords in the job description and incorporate them naturally.
- Example: "Software Engineering Intern" should have terms like "Python", "Agile", "Data Structures", etc.
