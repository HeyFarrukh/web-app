## :icon[lucide-file-question] Why Your CV Might Be Holding You Back

> In the world of apprenticeship applications, first impressions are everything. Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) is your first opportunity, your first chance to leave an imprint of yourself, and traverse through the application process. A well-crafted CV is not just a list of your experiences—it's a powerful story of who you are, what you've achieved, and where you're going.

> Your CV is more than just a document; it's your personal brand, and in the competitive world of job hunting, it’s the first thing potential employers will see. So, how do you make yours stand out in a sea of applicants?

> Think of it as the chance to strategically <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/personal-branding-at-work">brand</a> yourself: Highlight the skills, experiences, and achievements that speak directly to the role and its requirements. Whether it’s adjusting the emphasis on your education or tweaking the wording in your personal statement, building and customising a quality CV shows recruiters that you’ve put in the effort to align your experience with their needs.

Here's a template from an award-winning recruitment agency, from which many template examples throughout this guide are sourced from: <a href="/cv-guide-resources/dartmouth.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth CV</a>

## :icon[lucide-file-stack] Creating Your "Master CV"

**What is a Master CV?**

A "Master CV" is a comprehensive document that contains *all* of your work experience, skills, education, and achievements.  Think of it as your CV "toolbox."  You'll then select and tailor specific pieces from this toolbox to create targeted CVs for each job application.

**Why Create a Master CV?**

*   Saves Time: You don't have to start from scratch each time you apply for a job.
*   Ensures Completeness: You won't forget any important details.
*   Provides a Foundation: It's easier to tailor a CV than to create one from nothing.

**Action Step:** Create a new document titled "Master CV" and start listing *everything* you've ever done, both professionally and academically. We'll show you how to organise it in the following sections.

## :icon[lucide-square-user] Introduction

Consider adding a concise introduction below your contact information. This is your opportunity to quickly grab the recruiter's attention and highlight why you're a great fit for the role.

**Tips for Writing a Compelling Introduction:**

*   **Keep it brief:** Aim for a couple of sentences max.
*   **Incorporate keywords from the job description:** Carefully review the job description and identify key skills, qualifications, and requirements.  Incorporate these keywords naturally into your introduction to show that you understand what the employer is looking for. For example: "Highly motivated data science graduate with experience in Python and machine learning."
*   **Show your passion and enthusiasm:** Let your personality shine through and convey your genuine interest in the role and the company.
*   **Tailor it to each job:** Don't use the same introduction for every application. Customise it to match the specific requirements of each job, having a Master CV will save you time.

**Example Introduction (Data Scientist Role):**

> Highly motivated data science graduate with proven skills in Python and machine learning. Eager to apply my analytical abilities and contribute to innovative projects at Acme Corp. Passionate about leveraging data to solve complex business problems.

## :icon[lucide-building-2] Work Experience

| Element | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Company Name** |  Name of the company where you worked. |  Acme Corp |
| **Location, Country** | City and country where the company is located. | London, UK |
| **Role/Event** |  Your job title or the name of the event. | Data Scientist Intern |
| **Start - End Date** |  The period you worked there.  Use "Present" if you still work there. | Feb 2023 - Present |
| **Responsibilities & Achievements** |  Use bullet points to describe your key responsibilities and achievements.  Focus on impact. |  <ul><li>Led the development of X</li><li>Reduced costs by £££</li></ul> |

<br/>

### Example Work Experience Entry

**Acme Corp**  
London, UK

*Data Scientist Intern*  
Feb 2023 - Present

- Collaborated with a team of data engineers to develop a Python script using Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and preprocessing a large dataset of legislative documents, reducing data inconsistencies by 30% and improving data quality for downstream analysis.
- Participated in code reviews and provided feedback to other team members, ensuring code quality and adherence to coding standards

>  :icon[lucide-info] Remember if you are applying for ‘Project Management’ for instance, you could focus more on how you handled constraints, or coordinated resources, and write “Project Manager Intern” or the relevant role instead.

>  :icon[lucide-info] If possible, each experience should cover a different part of the job description, or your skillset, instead of repeating similar points. Even if you completed similar tasks, you can break down subsections of an experience, to emphasise versatility and willingness to learn - key attributes for an apprentice.




### Quick Tips for Your CV:

|                                      |                                                                                         |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]       | Try to keep each point between 1 and 2 lines.                                                         |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]        | **What you did & how (skills/job description) → Measurable impact (quantified).**                                                     |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] | Use keywords which emphasise the soft skills essential for the role, e.g. “Co-ordinated the team...”, “Analysed survey responses to identify trends…”.                  |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                | When adapting the master CV to an application, consider the culture of the company and the job description.                                                          |
| :icon[lucide-clipboard-check]                   | **Never lie!** Authenticity is crucial.                                                |


<br/>

## :icon[lucide-clipboard-check] Considerations:

-   **Consistency is KEY!**
-   Always start from most to least recent
-   Ensure no spelling or grammar errors.
-   Some companies will have AI filtering. To prepare for this, try and use as many important keywords from the job description which naturally fit. Use our [FREE CV Optimiser](/optimise-cv) to help you
-   When read by a recruiter, they will spend less than a minute reading, so focus on what you did, and why it mattered (impact) in the first line of each experience -**Measurable impacts!**
-   If it’s hard to quantify your work, use “Action” & “Result” from the <a href = "https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/starr-method">STARR framework</a>, and estimate the impact of what you did

### 2. Common CV Mistakes to Avoid
- Overloading with unnecessary details.
- Using clichés like "hardworking" without proving it.
- Spelling and grammar mistakes (Our <a href="/optimise-cv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV Optimiser</a> can proofread your CV.

### 3. CV Formatting & Readability
- Recommended fonts: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (size 10-12).
- Use bullet points and clear section headings.
- Keep margins at 0.5” to 1” for professional formatting.
- Make sure your CV is between 1-2 pages.

### 4. How to Write Impactful Bullet Points
- **Situation**: Describe the context.
- **Task**: What was your responsibility?
- **Action**: What did you do?
- **Result**: What was the outcome?
- **Reflection**: What did you learn from this experience?

#### Example:
- ❌ **Researched companies and helped analysts with investments.**
- ✅ **"Conducted market research on FTSE 100 companies, supporting senior analysts in investment recommendations that contributed to a 15% increase in portfolio performance."**

### 5. Online Presence & Portfolio

[Example LinkedIn](http://link.apprenticewatch.com/5PtUPT)
- GitHub & personal website for tech roles – Showcase projects and open-source contributions. <br/>
[Example GitHub](https://link.apprenticewatch.com/EyGz8w)

### 6. The Power of Keywords (Beating ATS Systems)
- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan [CVs](https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/ats-resumes) for relevant keywords.
- Find keywords in the job description and incorporate them naturally.
- Example: "Software Engineering Intern" should have terms like "Python", "Agile", "Data Structures", etc.
