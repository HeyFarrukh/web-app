# Getting Started with Enhanced Markdown

Welcome to our enhanced markdown platform! This article will show you ==how to use all the special features== available to make your content more engaging and expressive.

## Basic Formatting

You can use all the standard markdown formatting like **bold**, *italic*, and ***bold italic*** text. You can also create [links to websites](https://example.com) and insert images:

![Sample image alt text](/images/sample.jpg "Sample image title")

## Using Icons

Icons can make your content more visually appealing. Here are some examples:

**Font Awesome Icons**

:icon[fa-solid fa-check] Use the check icon for completed items  
:icon[fa-solid fa-lightbulb] The lightbulb is great for tips and ideas  
:icon[fa-solid fa-warning] Use the warning icon for important notices  
:icon[fa-brands fa-twitter] Add social media icons when needed 

**Lucide Icons**

:icon[lucide-check] Use Lucide Icons

:icon[lucide-github] Lucide Icons are also available

:icon[lucide-star] Lucide Icons are also available

## Text Highlighting

You can ==highlight important information== to make it stand out. This is perfect for key points you want readers to remember.

## How to Use Article Features

<span class="badge-primary">new</span> <span class="badge-info">guide</span> <span class="badge-success">beginner</span>

## Using Badges

Badges are a great way to highlight important information or categorize content. They're designed to look like modern coding or keyword badges with a clean, minimal style. Here's how to use them:

```markdown
<span class="badge-primary">primary</span>
<span class="badge-secondary">secondary</span>
<span class="badge-success">success</span>
<span class="badge-danger">danger</span>
<span class="badge-warning">warning</span>
<span class="badge-info">info</span>
```

Which will render as:

<span class="badge-primary">primary</span>
<span class="badge-secondary">secondary</span>
<span class="badge-success">success</span>
<span class="badge-danger">danger</span>
<span class="badge-warning">warning</span>
<span class="badge-info">info</span>

## Creating Premium Tables

Tables in ApprenticeWatch articles have a premium glassmorphism effect. Here's an example:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Badges | Modern keyword-style badges | <span class="badge-success">available</span> |
| Tables | Premium glassmorphism tables | <span class="badge-success">available</span> |
| CTAs | Elegant call-to-action sections | <span class="badge-success">available</span> |
| Code Blocks | Syntax highlighting | <span class="badge-success">available</span> |
| Blockquotes | Styled quote sections | <span class="badge-success">available</span> |

## Adding Call-to-Action Sections

To add a call-to-action (CTA) section to your article, use the following format:

```markdown
<div class="article-cta">
  <h3 class="article-cta-title">Ready to Start Your Apprenticeship Journey?</h3>
  <p class="article-cta-description">Join thousands of apprentices who have found their dream career path with ApprenticeWatch.</p>
  <a href="/register" class="article-cta-button">Get Started Today</a>
</div>
```

Which will render as a beautiful CTA section with an elegant animation on hover:

<div class="article-cta">
  <h3 class="article-cta-title">Ready to Start Your Apprenticeship Journey?</h3>
  <p class="article-cta-description">Join thousands of apprentices who have found their dream career path with ApprenticeWatch.</p>
  <a href="/register" class="article-cta-button">Get Started Today</a>
</div>

## Blockquote Styling

Blockquotes are styled with a subtle orange accent:

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it." 
> 
> â€” Abraham Lincoln

## Keywords Section

At the end of each article, a keywords section will automatically be generated based on the tags defined in the article's frontmatter. These keywords will appear as badges, making it easy for readers to identify related topics.

## Conclusion

Using these formatting features will help you create engaging and visually appealing articles that provide value to your readers. Experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your content.

<div class="article-cta">
  <h3 class="article-cta-title">Want to See More Examples?</h3>
