## Finding Companies to Research

1.  **[ApprenticeWatch](/apprenticeships)**
2.  **Industry-specific websites** and job boards (do your own research)
3.  **Company websites**
4.  **Career fairs** - connect directly with employers offering apprenticeships (this can be at your school, or other colleges which specialise in an industry, e.g. Ada, the National College & Computer Science.)
5.  **School career advisors** who may have established relationships with local employers
6.  **Social media platforms** like LinkedIn, where companies often post opportunities

## What to Research About Companies

### Company Basics:

*   **SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats):** This helps you gain an overall understanding of the business
*   History and recent developments
*   Main competitors
*   Industry trends and challenges
*   Recent innovations or achievements
*   Company values and culture

### Apprenticeship Program Details

*   Program structure and duration
*   Qualifications offered
*   Progression opportunities
*   Support provided to apprentices

### Online Presence

*   Company website (especially careers/apprenticeship pages)
*   Social media accounts
*   News articles and press releases
*   Employee reviews on sites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/)

### Practical Research Methods

*   **[Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)** - AI research tool (*We highly recommend using it for research*)
*   **Follow companies on social media** to stay updated on news and developments
*   **Set up Google Alerts** for companies you're interested in
*   **Attend virtual or in-person open days** if offered
*   **Speak with current or former apprentices** through LinkedIn or school networks
*   **Review annual reports** (for larger companies) to understand business performance

## Preparing Your Application!

### Match Your Skills to Their Requirements

*   Highlight relevant skills and experiences
*   Use examples that demonstrate these skills
*   Connect your interests to their industry

### Tailor Your CV

*   Customise your CV for each application with our [CV optimiser](/cv-optimiser) (Itâ€™s Free)
*   Use keywords from the job description
*   Emphasise achievements relevant to the role

### Prepare for Common Questions

*   Why do you want to work for this company specifically?
*   What do you know about our products/services?
*   How do your skills align with our values?
*   What interests you about this industry?

## Before Interviews

*   **Review all your research notes**
*   **Prepare questions** that show you've done your homework
*   **Practice explaining** why you're interested in that specific company
*   **Rehearse responses** to common interview questions using company-specific examples
*   **Plan your journey** to the interview location or test your technology for virtual interviews

## Final Tips

*   **Keep your research organised** in a document or spreadsheet for easy reference
*   **Stay up-to-date** with company news right up until your interview
*   **Be authentic** in your interest - employers can spot generic applications
*   **Quality over quantity** - it's better to submit fewer, well-researched applications than many generic ones

Remember, thorough research not only helps you get the apprenticeship but also ensures you're applying to opportunities that truly match your interests and career goals. Good luck with your applications!
