## How to Apply for Work Experience

Work experience is a valuable opportunity to explore careers, build professional skills, and strengthen your CV. Here's how to successfully apply for work experience placements:

### Research Potential Placements

Start by identifying companies or organisations that interest you. As a younger student you should focus on companies with established work experience programs (such as [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/careers/early-careers/early-careers-programmes.html) and [PwC](https://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/early-careers/our-programmes/insight-weeks.html)), organisations that partner with your school, and online placements ([Speakers For Schools](https://www.speakersforschools.org/work-experience-opportunities/), [Springpod](https://www.springpod.com/), and [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) to name a few)

Make sure to note the location, the time period, and the type of work they do before applying. Whilst the whole point of work experience is to expand your horizons, it may be best to start somewhere which appears to align with your interests the most.

### Preparing Your CV

Before applying, get these essentials ready:

*   **CV/Resume:** Create a simple one-page document highlighting your education, skills, and any relevant experience so far; this could be a personal project or even volunteer work you have done so far. Make sure to also include extracurricular activities that demonstrate valuable skills. Still not sure how to build a CV? Check out our [CV Guide](/resources/cv-guide)!
*   **Cover Letter:** This is a professional letter explaining why you're interested in the placement and what you hope to gain from it. Whilst it is unlikely that a company would ask this from you, understanding how to write one, and knowing how you would compile one for a given company will increase your understanding of the role, and the mutual relationship between yourself and the company.

### Where to Find Work Experience

The 3 main ways to approach companies nowadays would be online, through email, or through school connections (using your school's career advisor or work experience coordinator). Here is a list of websites to look for or gain work experience:

*   [Success at School](https://www.successatschool.org/)
*   [Student Ladder](https://studentladder.co.uk/work-experience/)
*   [Career Bay](https://careerbay.co.uk/)
*   [Spark Charity](https://sparkcharity.org.uk/what-we-do/work-experience/)
*   [Prospects](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/work-experience-and-internships)
*   [Tech Academia](https://www.techacademia.co.uk/work-experience/)
*   [The Brokerage](https://www.thebrokerage.org.uk/jobs-work-experience/)
*   [Springpod](https://www.springpod.com/) 

### What to Include in Your Application

When writing your application, be sure to:

*   Explain why you're interested in that specific company
*   Mention your availability and preferred dates (if requested)
*   Highlight relevant skills and interests
*   Be clear about what you hope to learn
*   Show enthusiasm and professionalism!

### Follow Up

After submitting your application:

*   Wait at least one week (or the specified time) before following up if you haven't heard back
*   Send a polite email to check on the status if it is taking long
*   Be prepared to be flexible with dates if necessary
*   Thank the person for their time and consideration

Remember, even if you don't get your first-choice placement, any work experience is valuable. The skills you gain from applying — communication, perseverance, and professionalism — are important for your future career.

Good luck with your applications!

## How to Get the Best Out of the Experience!

### Preparing for Success

Work experience is a valuable opportunity to learn, grow, and potentially discover your future career path. Once you secure a placement:

*   **Planning and Transportation:** Confirm all details including dates, times, dress code, and who to report to, then plan your transportation to and from the workplace.
*   **Set Clear Goals:** Think about what you want to achieve during your placement. Are you looking to develop specific skills, explore a particular industry, or make professional connections? Having clear objectives will help you stay focused.
*   **Research the Company:** Understanding the organisation's values, work culture, and what they do will help you to find the best way to work, and ask insightful questions.
*   **Prepare Questions:** Create a list of questions about the industry, roles, and career paths to ask during your placement. This shows your enthusiasm and helps you gain valuable insights.

### During Your Placement

*   **Be Professional:** First impressions matter! Arrive on time, dress appropriately, and maintain a positive attitude. Treat your work experience as if it were a real job.
*   **Take Initiative:** Don't wait to be told what to do. Once you've completed assigned tasks, ask if there's anything else you can help with. Showing initiative demonstrates your enthusiasm and work ethic. Even if this work experience isn’t the most engaging, developing rigour will help you to gain more from the experience, and reference back to it for future applications.
*   **Ask for Feedback:** Regular feedback helps you improve. Ask your supervisor how you're doing and what you could do better.
*   **Keep a Daily Journal:** Record what you've learned, challenges you've faced, and achievements you're proud of. This will be valuable when updating your CV and reflecting on your experience later.
*   **Network:** Make an effort to talk to different people in the organisation. Ask about their roles, career paths, and advice they have for someone starting out. These connections could be valuable in the future, and help build your understanding of the industry.

### After Your Placement

*   **Send Thank You Notes:** Express your gratitude to your supervisor and others who helped you during your placement. A quick message before you leave, a LinkedIn post, or a personalised email can make a lasting impression. Keep in mind the culture of the company when you choose the medium, as LinkedIn is generally a good bet, but an email or verbal thanks could be more mindful.
*   **Update Your CV:** Add your work experience to your CV while it's still fresh in your mind, highlighting the impact you made and achievements you're proud of.
*   **Reflect on Your Experience:** Consider what you enjoyed, what you didn't, and how this experience has shaped your career aspirations, as this will guide your future decisions.
*   **Stay Connected:** Keep in touch with the contacts you made. Connect on LinkedIn or keep their emails handy, as these connections could lead to future opportunities.

### Making the Most of Virtual Work Experience

If your work experience is more like a course, approach it like coursework or a project, and allocate dedicated time in an appropriate workspace. If your placement is virtual:

*   **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** Find a quiet, well-lit area where you can focus without distractions.
*   **Test Your Setup:** Ensure your internet connection, device, camera, and microphone work properly before your first day.
*   **Stay Engaged:** Actively participate in virtual meetings, ask questions, and contribute ideas when appropriate.
*   **Communicate Clearly:** When you're not in the same physical space, clear communication becomes even more important. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification if needed.

Remember, the value of work experience extends far beyond just having something to put on your CV. It's about developing skills, gaining insights, and discovering what you enjoy. Approach it with enthusiasm and curiosity, and you'll reap the benefits for years to come!
