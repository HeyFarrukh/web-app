            <p>Permission is granted to temporarily access and view the information and apprenticeship listings provided on ApprenticeWatch's website for personal, non-commercial informational purposes only.

                <li>modify or copy the content for commercial purposes;</li>
                <li>use the content for any public display (commercial or non-commercial) beyond sharing links to the website;</li>

            <p>This licence shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by ApprenticeWatch at any time. </p>

            <h2>3. Disclaimer Regarding Apprenticeship Listings</h2>
            <p>ApprenticeWatch provides a platform for users to access information about apprenticeship opportunities across the United Kingdom. **Please be aware that the apprenticeship listings displayed on ApprenticeWatch are gathered from various external sources via APIs. ApprenticeWatch does not create these listings and therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or availability of any specific apprenticeship opportunity.**</p>
            <p>Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We strongly advise you to verify the details of any apprenticeship that interests you directly with the employer or training provider listed.</p>

            <h2>4. General Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The information provided on ApprenticeWatch's website is for general informational purposes only.
